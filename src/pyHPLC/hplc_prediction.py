        ----------
        samples : list of hplc_data instances

            lists therefore contains as many items as in spectrum_wavelengths.
        wavelengths : ndarray, optional
            Wavelengths used for calculating the absorption spectra. The
            default is np.linspace(200, 400, 201).
        times : ndarray, optional
